# Professional Self-Assessment

My professional focus centers on systems engineering, embedded software, and secure system design. I am particularly interested in environments where software interacts directly with hardware and operational constraints. This capstone demonstrates that I can design, analyze, secure, and improve computing systems in a structured and professional manner.
This ePortfolio represents both the culmination of my academic development and a foundation for continued growth in the computer science field.

# Enhancement One – Software Engineering

This enhancement focused on refactoring and restructuring the original thermostat application to improve modularity, readability, and maintainability. I reorganized control flow, clarified function responsibilities, and improved documentation to align with professional software engineering standards. The result is a cleaner, more extensible system that better supports future feature expansion and testing.

# Enhancement Two – Algorithms & Data Structures

This enhancement emphasized improving algorithmic structure and performance awareness within the application. I analyzed data handling and control logic to ensure efficient processing and clearer data organization. The updated implementation reflects stronger application of algorithmic principles and improved scalability while maintaining correctness.

# Enhancement Three – Databases

This enhancement introduced structured SQLite logging to add persistent data storage to the thermostat system. I designed a relational schema, integrated database operations into the application workflow, and enabled time-series logging for temperature and system state. This transformed the project from a real-time controller into a traceable and analyzable system with persistent data support.
