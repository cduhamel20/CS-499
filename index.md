Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University strengthened both my technical foundation and my professional direction. Throughout this program, I developed practical experience in software engineering, algorithms, databases, testing, and secure coding. This ePortfolio reflects measurable growth in my ability to design, evaluate, and improve computing solutions that deliver real value.

The artifacts included represent progression rather than isolated coursework. Each enhancement demonstrates refinement, structured thinking, and professional-level improvement.

## Technical Growth

In CS 350, I developed and enhanced an embedded thermostat application. Through refactoring and modular redesign, I improved maintainability, control flow clarity, and system structure. The database enhancement added structured SQLite logging, transforming the project from a real-time controller into a traceable system capable of persistent data analysis. This required schema design, query integration, and clean separation between application logic and storage.

My algorithm-focused enhancement strengthened my ability to evaluate performance and data organization. I analyzed efficiency tradeoffs and improved implementation clarity while maintaining correctness. This reinforced the importance of designing solutions that are both functional and scalable.

Coursework in secure coding and reverse engineering strengthened my security mindset. I now approach development with proactive consideration of input validation, error handling, surface exposure, and system resilience. Security is no longer an afterthought but an integrated design principle.

## Collaboration and Communication

Throughout the program, I developed the ability to communicate technical decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. Producing structured documentation and a code review video required articulating design choices, identifying improvement areas, and justifying tradeoffs. These communication skills are essential in collaborative engineering environments where clarity directly impacts decision-making and implementation quality.

## Integrated Skill Set

Together, the software engineering, algorithm, and database enhancements demonstrate my ability to:

- Design and refactor structured systems  
- Apply algorithmic principles to real implementations  
- Integrate persistent data storage  
- Maintain secure coding practices  
- Deliver professional-quality technical communication  

These artifacts collectively reflect a systems-oriented approach rather than isolated programming exercises.

## Professional Direction

My professional focus centers on systems engineering, embedded software, and secure system design. I am particularly interested in environments where software interacts directly with hardware and operational constraints. This capstone demonstrates my ability to design, analyze, secure, and improve computing systems in a structured and professional manner.

This ePortfolio represents both the culmination of my academic development and a foundation for continued growth in the computer science field.

# Enhancement One – Software Engineering

This enhancement focused on refactoring and restructuring the original thermostat application to improve modularity, readability, and maintainability. I reorganized control flow, clarified function responsibilities, and improved documentation to align with professional software engineering standards. The result is a cleaner, more extensible system that better supports future feature expansion and testing.

# Enhancement Two – Algorithms & Data Structures

This enhancement emphasized improving algorithmic structure and performance awareness within the application. I analyzed data handling and control logic to ensure efficient processing and clearer data organization. The updated implementation reflects stronger application of algorithmic principles and improved scalability while maintaining correctness.

# Enhancement Three – Databases

This enhancement introduced structured SQLite logging to add persistent data storage to the thermostat system. I designed a relational schema, integrated database operations into the application workflow, and enabled time-series logging for temperature and system state. This transformed the project from a real-time controller into a traceable and analyzable system with persistent data support.
